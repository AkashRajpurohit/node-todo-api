## TODO App using Node.js and MongoDB

This was a fun project given to us (Me & [Tarun Parmar](https://github.com/Underrooz)) when we were applying for internship from our college. The [company](https://www.raweng.com/) asked us to build this Todo Application with MEAN Stack and had certain sets of tasks that we had to complete in the given time (24 hours)
I created the Backend with testing and deployment of the backend on heroku. Tarun created the UI in Angular and consumed the api's to make the application work seamlessly. We did manage to complete what was asked to do and got the internship ðŸ˜Š


## Things I learnt in this quick project -

1. How to collaborate with others to make the project flow go smoothly
2. Leaned how to modularize the applications and make proper use of utility functions for maintaining better codebase
3. Adding JWT Authentication and protecting certain routes to only logged in users
4. Handling server side validations.
5. Writing tests using jest by testing out the api endpoints

and many more...
